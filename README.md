# BudgetAware-AI-Squad 🤖💰
Proactive Governance for the Agentic Cloud.

Traditional FinOps is reactive—you find out about a $5,000 bill 48 hours too late. In the era of autonomous agents, costs can spiral in seconds.

BudgetAware-AI-Squad is a decentralized framework that integrates financial self-awareness into AI agent meshes. It acts as a "Fiscal Guardrail," ensuring that autonomous systems stay within budget while maintaining high task performance.

✨ Key Capabilities
🛡️ Agentic Circuit Breakers: Automatically halts recursive agent "chatter" before budgets are exceeded.

⚖️ Dynamic Model Routing: Intelligently switches between local SLMs (via Ollama) and frontier LLMs based on task complexity and remaining funds.

📈 Real-time Telemetry: Dashboard for unit-cost-per-task tracking (UCST), shifting from infrastructure monitoring to agentic monitoring.
